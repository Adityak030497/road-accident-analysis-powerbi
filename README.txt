🚦 Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze accident trends and severity patterns for the years 2021 and 2022.

The goal is to transform raw accident data into actionable insights that can help transport authorities identify high-risk conditions and improve road safety planning.

🎯 Problem Statement

Transport authorities require a data-driven solution to:

Monitor total accidents and casualties

Compare Year-over-Year (YoY) performance

Analyze accident severity distribution

Identify high-risk vehicle categories

Examine accident patterns by road type, area, and lighting conditions

Understand geographic accident concentration

This dashboard provides a structured analytical view to support informed decision-making.

📊 Key KPIs (Primary Metrics)

Total CY Casualties

Total CY Accidents

Fatal Casualties

Serious Casualties

Slight Casualties

Year-over-Year % Change

These KPIs provide a high-level summary of accident trends and severity shifts between 2021 and 2022.

📈 Analytical Breakdown (Secondary Metrics)

The dashboard includes multi-dimensional analysis across:

🚗 Vehicle Type

🛣 Road Type

🌆 Urban vs Rural Areas

🌗 Light Conditions (Day/Night)

📅 Monthly Trend (CY vs PY Comparison)

🗺 Geographic Location Mapping

Interactive filters allow deeper exploration by road surface and weather conditions.

🧠 Key Insights

Slight injuries account for the majority of total casualties.

Urban areas contribute a higher proportion of accidents compared to rural areas.

Single carriageway roads show the highest number of casualties.

Most accidents occur during daylight conditions.

Cars represent the largest share of vehicle-related casualties.

Monthly trends reveal seasonal fluctuations in accident frequency.
